# Python-3.5-to-.exe

Made by: Elias Bothell

First of all, I hate things that are made by other people that I can make better.

I dont like py2exe because it is for python 2.7, this works for python 3.5.

it works with .py and .pyw files.

Use this for whatever you wanr, I dont care.

Im sorry if it sucks but this is written in C++ and I don't know C++. 

I included the source files so you can fix it and do with it what you wish.

"Its a feature, not a bug"

enjoy!
